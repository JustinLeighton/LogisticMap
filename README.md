# Logistic Map

Inspired by the popular [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovJcsL7vyrk&vl=en) by Veritasium on the subject, I wanted to write a script that efficiently computed and generated a high-resolution image of the bifurcation diagram of the logistic map. This script heavily leverages vectorization through the use of numpy in order to gain a lot of computational efficiency.
